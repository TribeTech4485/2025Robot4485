# 4485

The code for team 4485's robot for the year 2025, in the frc game REEFSCAPE.\
This is the first year for our team to use a swerve-drive system.

## TO SAVE

Always use the command line git to install as shown below, or it will not work:\
`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/TribeTech4485/2025Robot4485`

Odds are, if you are reading this because you cloned through the GUI, so use the command below while in the repo to fix:

`git submodule update --init --recursive`

## When using

Also note the sub-repository/submodule [SyncedLibraries](https://github.com/TribeTech4485/SyncedLibraries). The README there should explain the basics of how to operate.
