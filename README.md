# TO SAVE

Always use the command line git to install as shown below, or it will not work:

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/TribeTech4485/2025Robot4485`

Odds are, if you are reading this because you cloned through the GUI, so use the command below while in the repo to fix:

`git submodule update --init --recursive`
